## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee promotions within an organization using a comprehensive data analysis approach. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), clustering, and classification. Various machine learning algorithms are applied to build predictive models and derive actionable insights.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this project consists of employee records, including various features relevant to their professional and demographic details. The data includes information such as:
- Employee ID
- Age
- Department
- Education
- Gender
- Previous Year Rating
- Length of Service
- KPIs Met
- Awards Won
- Average Training Score

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used for analysis and model building.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning algorithms, including clustering, classification, and predictive modeling.
- **SciPy:** For statistical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive data analysis and documentation.

## Data Analysis and Modeling
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handled missing values.
- Performed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis.
- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### Clustering
- Implemented K-Means clustering.
